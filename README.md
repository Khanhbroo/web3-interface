# Web3 Campaign – Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform
🚀 Overview
This is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built with Solidity, Foundry, React.js, TailwindCSS, and Lucide icons. Users can fund directly on-chain. The contract updates the funder count and balance immediately after each contribution.

**🎯 Key Features**
- 💰 Fund Campaigns – Supporters can donate ETH directly via smart contracts.
- 🔄 Real-Time Updates – When a user funds a campaign, the smart contract instantly updates the funder count and balance.
- 🔐 Secure Transactions – All funds are directly handled via smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security.
- 🎨 User-Friendly UI – Built with React and TailwindCSS for seamless interaction.

**🛠 Tech Stack**
- Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS, Lucide
- Blockchain: Solidity, Foundry
- Smart Contracts: Ethereum, Sepolia Testnet
- Wallet Integration: Reown AppKit

**📌 How It Works**
- Connect Wallet – Users connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- Fund to CrowdFunding – Users can send ETH to support this crowd funding.
- Smart Contract Execution – The contract updates the funder count and balance immediately.
- Monitor Campaigns – Users can track the campaign’s funding progress.

**🏆 Vision & Goals**
- Our goal is to make crowdfunding more transparent, decentralized, and efficient using blockchain technology. This project eliminates intermediaries and ensures secure, real-time transactions for campaign creators and backers.

## Installation  
To get started with this project, install all required dependencies:  

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage  
First, create a `.env` file and add your **Project ID** and **Alchemy Sepolia Key**:  

```env
VITE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID  
VITE_ALCHEMY_SEPOLIA_KEY=YOUR_SEPOLIA_KEY  
```

### Don't have a **Project ID** or **Alchemy Key**? Follow these steps:

2. **Get an Alchemy Sepolia Key:**  
   - Sign up on [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) and create a new project.  
   - Locate the **RPC URL** for the **Sepolia** network.  

💡 **Note:** You can switch to a different RPC provider if preferred.


## To launch the project, run the following command in your terminal:
``` bash
npm run dev
```
Once the development server starts, open **http://localhost:5173/** in your browser to view the project. Your application should now be visible, similar to the example shown below:
